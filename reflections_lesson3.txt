Reflections about lesson 3:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when working in a team

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- when working on a feature I don't want unknown code changes to destroy the current status of it
