Reflections about lesson 3:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- when working in a team

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- when working on a feature I don't want unknown code changes to destroy the current status of it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: cloned repository and original repository are on github
Clones: cloned repositories is local, original repository can be on github or local
Branches: temporary copy of the repository to develop features or to work on bugfixes etc.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can compare the last known state of the remote with local branches by using git log and git diff

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
No idea
